        <h1> So, who am I?</h1>
        <p>"I am a curious person who loves learning new things every day. 
            I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, and I like to explore different hobbies like  dancing, hiking , and cooking .
             I believe in being kind to others and always try my best to help when I can.
             I'm still figuring out my path in life, but I am excited about what the future holds.
             I value honesty and appreciate people who are genuine and open-minded. 
             I also love nature and enjoy taking walks or spending time outdoors when I need to relax. 
             Above all, I strive to grow and become the best version of myself."
